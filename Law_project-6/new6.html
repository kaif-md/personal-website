                <p class="center">Criminal law is an area of the law that concerns crimes and laws applied to those who
                    commit them.
                    There are two main types of criminal law offenses: felonies and misdemeanors.
                    The most serious crimes are felonies, which include offenses like murder, robbery, and arson.</p>

                <p class="center">Administrative law is a division of law governing the activities of executive branch
                    agencies of government.
                    Administrative law includes executive branch rule making (executive branch rules are generally
                    referred to as "regulations"), adjudication, and the enforcement of laws.
                    Administrative law is considered a branch of public law.
                    Administrative law deals with the decision-making of such administrative units of government that
                    are part of the executive branch in such areas as international trade, manufacturing, the
                    environment, taxation, broadcasting, immigration, and transport.</p>

                <h2 class="h-secondary center">CIVIL LAW</h2>
                <p class="center">Civil law is a legal system originating in mainland Europe and adopted in much of the
                    world.
                    The civil law system is intellectualized within the framework of Roman law, and with core principles
                    codified into a referable system, which serves as the primary source of law.
                    The civil law system is often contrasted with the common law system, which originated in medieval
                    England.
                    Whereas the civil law takes the form of legal codes, the law in common law systems historically came
                    from uncodified case law that arose as a result of judicial decisions,
                    recognising prior court decisions as legally binding precedent.</p>

                <p class="center">SUBSTANTIVE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW means the law that deals with the substantive aspects
                    of the law like the rights, responsibilities, and authority of the body.
                    It focuses on the legal power and scope of an administrative agency’s acts, such as the rules and
                    regulations that can be promulgated, the decisions that can be made, and the enforcement measures
                    that can be implemented.Substantive administrative law deals with the legality, legitimacy, and
                    scope of an agency’s power. Some examples of this are the food safety and standards act, competition
                    law, consumer protection act, company law, etc.</p>

                    like the penalties, punishments, and processes of the agency by using the substantive aspects of law
                    i.e., powers, authority, and functions. It provides fairness, openness, and due process in
                    administrative decision-making by giving notices to people, the right to be heard, and the capacity
                    to appeal or seek judicial review of administrative acts. Some examples of this law are the
                    administrative procedure act, income tax act, election laws, etc.

                <p class="center">DELEGATED LEGISLATION is a category in administrative law that delegates or transfers
                    the law-making authority to make rules, regulations, and bylaws for better administrative bodies.
                    Through this power, the agencies can make amendments to the act and add provisions if needed to fill
                    the gaps in the laws. This power is delegated with limitations and reasonable restrictions so that
                    the administrative agencies cannot misuse the powers. Rules and regulations created by agencies like
                    the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) regarding the operation of banks, the Securities and Exchange Board
                    of India (SEBI) for monitoring securities markets, and the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) for
                    income tax rules are examples of delegated legislation in India.</p>

                <h2 class="h-secondary center">INTERNAL ADMINISTRATIVE LAW</h2>
                <p class="center">INTERNAL ADMINISTRATIVE LAW focuses on the internal operations, processes, and
                    relations of administrative agencies. It regulates things like organisational structure,
                    decision-making procedures, authority delegation, and internal governance systems. Internal
                    administrative law guarantees that administrative agencies work effectively, efficiently, and
                    following the norms and regulations in place.[15] In India, for example, the Department of Personnel
                    and Training (DoPT) develops internal administrative regulations and standards for government
                    ministries and public personnel.</p>

                    and external entities such as persons, organisations, and other divisions of government. It governs
                    administrative agencies’ powers, activities, and choices as they engage with the public and other
                    stakeholders. It ensures administrative activities are transparent, fair, and accountable. In India,
                    for example, the Right to Information Act, 2005 is an external administrative legislation that
                    grants citizens access to information maintained by public bodies, including administrative
                    agencies.

                <h3>Rulemaking :</h3>
                <p class="center"> In India, administrative authorities have the jurisdiction to create rules
                    and regulations that regulate various sectors. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), for example, creates
                    rules and regulations to control banking activities, such as standards for loans, interest rates,
                    and capital requirements.</p>
                <h3>Enforcement:</h3>
                <p class="center">
                    Administrative agencies are responsible for enforcing the rules and regulations that
                    they have set. In India, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) is in charge of enforcing
                    environmental legislation, conducting inspections, and prosecuting non-compliant enterprises or
                    persons.
                </p>
                <h3>Adjudication:</h3>
                <p class="center">
                    Adjudication is described as the legal procedure in which a judge or arbitrator evaluates evidence
                    and arguments presented by different parties to reach a conclusion on the matter at hand.[16] For
                    example, The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) adjudicates telecom industry disputes such
                    as licensing concerns and price disputes
